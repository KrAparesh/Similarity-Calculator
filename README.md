# Similarity Calculator

## Introduction
The Similarity Calculator is a tool designed to measure the similarity between two different statements using vector embeddings. This project uses hugging face's inference api to calculate and compare similarity scores, providing insights into how closely related the data sets are. This project will further be improved by adding local embedding capabilities which would enable a complete offline similarity comparison.
